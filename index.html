                Serbian-American inventor Nikola Tesla was born in July of 1856, in what is now Croatia. He came to the
                United States in 1884, and briefly worked with Thomas Edison before the two parted ways. He sold several
                patent rights, including those to his alternating-current machinery, to George Westinghouse. His 1891
                invention, the "Tesla coil," is still used in radio technology today. Tesla died in New York City on
                January 7, 1943.

                Famous Serbian-American inventor Nikola Tesla was born on July 10, 1856, in what is now Smiljan,
                Croatia. Tesla's interest in electrical invention was likely spurred by his mother, Djuka Mandic, who
                invented small household appliances in her spare time while her son was growing up. Tesla's father,
                Milutin Tesla, was a priest. After studying in the 1870s at the Realschule, Karlstadt (later renamed the
                Johann-Rudolph-Glauber Realschule Karlstadt); the Polytechnic Institute in Graz, Austria; and the
                University of Prague, Tesla began preparing for a trip to America.

                Tesla came to the United States in 1884, and soon began working with famed inventor and business mogul
                Thomas Edison. The two worked together for a brief period before parting ways due to a conflicting
                business-scientific relationship, attributed by historians to their incredibly different personalities:
                While Edison was a power figure who focused on marketing and financial success, Tesla was a commercially
                out-of-tune and somewhat vulnerable, yet extremely pivotal inventor, who pioneered some of history's
                most important inventions. His inventions include the "Tesla coil," developed in 1891, and an
                alternating-current electrical system of generators, motors and transformersâ€”both of which are still
                used widely today.

            <p class="bot">
                Over the past several years, several nonprofit organizations, high-profile individuals, municipalities
                and Tesla enthusiasts have been involved in a different kind of effort to uphold Tesla's legacy: A
                project to preserve Tesla's still-standing, still-abandoned New York laboratory, Wardenclyffe, and turn
                it into a museum of the famous inventor's work. For more than a decade, New York's Nikola Tesla Science
                Center has been working to gain momentum and, subsequently, funding for preserving Wardenclyffe. Since
                then, the lab's ownership has been passed through several hands, and public interest for the project has
                slowly but steadily been growing.

                Interest escalated in February 2009, when the Wardenclyffe site was posted for sale, for nearly $1.6
                million. For several years, the Tesla Science Center worked diligently to raise funds for the lab's
                preservation. The TSC was able to purchase the property in 2013 and plans to turn the site into a
                science museum.
